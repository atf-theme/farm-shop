# All The Farms Custom Shopify Theme

All The Farms (ATF) is the sponsor for this project. They are a data-driven organization whose goal is to promote local farms by getting the word out to consumers through their online directory. Using the directory, consumers can find farms that support ethical and sustainable practices which includes criteria such as BIPOC led, veteran led, and certified organic. 

ATF is looking to expand their services by integrating e-commerce to their website. This will be accomplished with a custom Shopify theme that simplifies the process of creating an online store, making it accessible to everyday farmers. A data importer may also be implemented to facilitate the transfer of the existing data from ATFâ€™s database to the Shopify theme. To ensure timely completion, the project team will use agile development methodology.
