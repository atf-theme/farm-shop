# All The Farms Custom Shopify Theme

All The Farms (ATF) is the sponsor for this project. They are a data-driven organization whose goal is to promote local farms by getting the word out to consumers through their online directory. Using the directory, consumers can find farms that support ethical and sustainable practices which includes criteria such as BIPOC led, veteran led, and certified organic. This custom Shopify theme will expand ATF's services by simplifying the process of creating an online store, making it accessible to everyday farmers.
